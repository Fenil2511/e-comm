- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.

Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>

```  

### Step 2 : Branch

**6.** Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

**7.** Add all the files/folders needed.

```bash  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
git add .
